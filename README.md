Track: Revamping the Old
A new way to visualize journal entries

This project focuses on individual person's wellbeing. This web-app serves as a daily journal for a registered user. It represents a user's mood via images and color.
  
How to use:
- Type in a daily journal
- Receive back an image representation of your mood
- View your monthly mood consolidated on a calendar

The web-app uses sentimental analysis to gauge the emotions of a user's journal entry. It encourages users to keep track of their mood on a daily basis. Upon inputting a journal, an image generated by the mood of the user entry is sent back to the user to reflect their current state of mind. We also have a page that provides users with resources and tips to help them with their mental health.

Frameworks Used: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebooks, and some python modules. 

Features we would like to add in the future:
- A rewards system
- A buddy system
- Social media sharing
